Internet protocal version 4 - ipv4 

IP - internet protocal that allows computers on a network to communicate with each other. 

ip establishes the data unit that is transferred between hosts usually a packet.
it also provides addressing for the hosts on the network to identify and locate them.
provides mechanisms for routing these packets between different hosts


ipv4 is a 32 bit address 
- contains 4 sections that are made up of 8 bits each (32 in total)
- each 8-bit section is known as byte or octet
- each octote can be converted to a decimal number between 0 and 255
-  most common way of presenting an ipv4 address dotted decimal notation 
- the number of ipv4 addresses is = 2^32 or just over 4 billion

internet protocal version 6 - ipv6 

- ipv6 creation was motivated on the fact that ipv4 ip address allocation could be exhausted. 
- ipv6 128-bit address 
- contains 8 sections that are made up of 16 bits (128 in total)
- refered to as a nibble
-  possible ip address with ipv6 amounts to = 2^128

ipv4 classes 

class a 0---
class b 10--
class c 110-  first 3 octets are for the ip address and the last octet refers to the host 
class d 1110
